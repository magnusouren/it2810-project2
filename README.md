## Documentation

This readme is intended to provide a brief overview of the project setup and available npm scripts.
Other documentation can be found in the [docs](./docs) folder.

## Project structure

The project is divided into two main folders: `client`, `server`.

### Client

The `client` folder contains the frontend code for the project.

The client documentation can be found in the [client/README.md](./client/README.md) file.

### Server

The `server` folder contains the backend code for the project.

The server documentation can be found in the [server/README.md](./server/README.md) file.

### Root

The `root` has its own `package.json` file, and is used to install dependencies common for the entire project. This includes Typescript, Eslint and Prettier. It also contains scripts for easy initialization of the client, server or both (if set up from before).

## Environment

The system is built on node v20.5.0 and npm v9.8.1. We cannot guarantee that other versions of node will run the project without complications.

To set correct node version, run:

```cli
nvm install 20.5.0
```

```cli
nvm use 20.5.0
```

> <i>Note: The project cannot be run with node 20.6.0.</i>

To set correct npm version, run:

```cli
npm install -g npm@9.8.1
```

The project have been developed and tested with Google Chrome, and therefore is best viewed in Google Chrome. Certain features may not work as intended in other browsers.

## Setup

### Basic setup

To setup the project for development, run:

```cli
npm run setup
```

This will concurrently install all dependencies for the project.

For client spesific setup, please follow instructions located in [./client/README.md](./client/README.md#run-the-client).

Once client is setup up, run:

```cli
npm run dev:client
```

> <i>Client spesific scripts will only be available when the shell is located in the `client` directory. Please navigate to the directory if you wish to use them or have more flexability.</i>

<hr />

### Local server

If you wish to set up a local backend server, please follow instructions located in [./server/README.md](./server/README.md#configuration).

> **Note**: You will need a valid database connection to run the server locally.

Once configured properly, start the server by running:

```cli
npm run dev:server
```

> <i>Server spesific scripts will only be available when the shell is located in the `server` directory. Please navigate to the directory if you wish to use them or have more flexability.</i>

<hr>

If both client and server is set up correctly, you can use the following script to run both the client and server concurrently in the same terminal:

```cli
npm run dev
```

This will start the project in development mode. The project will run locally on a local ports, initialized by Vite and node. Any code changes will trigger automatic browser- and server updates.

<i> Overview over all the scripts can be found in the section below.</i>
