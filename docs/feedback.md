# Feebacks from fellow students on P2

This document contains the feedback we received from fellow students after the deliveries. We have divided the feedback into P2-1 and P2-2, Some of the feedbacks that were frequently mentioned are collected into one feedback in this document. The feedbacks are translated from Norwegian to English. We have furthered reflected on the feedbacks and written down our thoughts about them. After making improvements, we have written down what we have done to improve the feedbacks.

## P2-1

### Remove filtering and sorting on the page of movies

#### Feedback

When I sort alphabetically and don't want to sort again, nothing happens. You might want to consider making the page revert to default when clicking “none” for sorting. This applies to both sorting by rating and alphabetically.

#### Our reflection

We have not thought about this before. We have now added a function that resets the sorting and filtering, even with a clear button or when clicking on the “none” option.

#### Improvement

TODO

### Design of the detailed Movie page

#### Feedback

- Some design elements have padding and rounded corners, while others don't.
- Some design elements use dark color tones, whereas others are light.
- The background doesn't seem to have a consistent fill, causing the generic background image for the page to cut through.
- On the movie page, there should be added margin or padding at the bottom to provide some space below the text.
- The background might be confusing in terms of contrast. Suggestions include blurring the background or changing its color.

#### Our reflection

This is usefull feedback on the design of the movie page. We will try to redesign the page to make it more user friendly.

TODO

### Go back button on the detailed Movie page

#### Feedback

There's a need for a back button on the detailed movie page. Currently, users have to click on the site's logo to navigate back.

#### Our reflection

We have not thought about this before. We have now added a back button on the detailed movie page. This function should also remember the previous state of page, genre, and sorting.

#### Improvements

TODO

### Functionality when logged in vs logged out

#### Feedback

There's a functionality that allows users to add movies to a watchlist even when they are not logged in, but these movies don't actually get added to a watchlist. This is confusing for users.

#### Our reflection

This is a bug we have not thought about before. We should fix this bug similar to have the rating works. When user is not logged in, user should be able to just read about the movies, not rate or put to watchlist.

#### Improvements

TODO

### Search functionallity

#### Feedback

The search feature only navigates to individual movie results, rather than displaying multiple results at once.

#### Our reflection

We will look into how much functionality we can add to the search functionallity. As it is now the functionallity is limited, and we will look into how we can improve it.
