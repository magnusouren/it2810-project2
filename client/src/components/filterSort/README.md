# FilterSort Component

## Testing

We have opted not to test this component as it is a difficult component to unit test. It is a component that is used to filter and sort other components, and as such, it is difficult to test the functionality of this component without testing the components that it is filtering and sorting. We have tested the functionality of this component through end to end testing.
